# AIR POLLUTION MONITORING AND CONTROLLING USING IOT
# Introduction:
The main objective of the IoT Air pollution Monitoring and controlling System is that 
Air pollution has been a primary concern in recent years. It is critical to control and control air 
quality for a brighter future and a healthy life for all of us. Because of its adaptability andlow 
cost,the Internet Of Things (IoT) has become increasingly popular. With the growth of cities and 
the number of drivers on the road, the atmospheric conditions have been considerably affected. 
Harmful effects of the pollution include mild reactionswhich can be irritation of the throat, eyes 
and nose as well as some majority problems like bronchitis, lung,heart diseases, pneumonia and 
aggravated asthma. Monitoring gives measurements of air pollution and sound pollution 
concentrations be analyzed, interpreted and presented. These information can then be applicable 
in multiple ways Analyzing of monitoring data allows us to assess how bad air pollution and 
sound polluting nowadays. Air pollution is the big problem of every nation, whether it is 
developed or developing. Health problems have be growing faster, especially in urban areas of 
developing countries where industrialization row increasing of vehicles leads to the lease of a lot 
of gaseous pollutants.
Harmful effects of the pollution mayinclude mild allergic reactions such as irritation of 
the throat, eyes and nose and these may causing heavy problems like bronchitis, heart diseases, 
and aggravated asthma etc. According to a survey, 50,000 to 100,000 pr premature deaths per 
year occur in the U.S. alone due to air pollution. IOT based air pollution monitoring system gets 
monitored these Air quality over a web server with the help of internet resources which may 
alarm and go down beyond a certain threshold level, which means when there are 
sufficientamountof hazardous gases present in the air such as Carbon dioxide , smoke, NH3, 
LPG and NOx. It shows the air quality in Parts per millionwith display and on the web page to
monitor it very quickly.

# Ways to control air pollution
  -Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.
  -Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.
  -Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.
  -Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.

# 4W's & 1H
## what
It is a project about montioring the hazardous gases.
## where 
Parking areas and pollutated environments.
## when
Whenever the normal environments becomes more hazardous.
## who 
An industrail organizations or an  public reformers.
## How
The project will be entertained once hazardous gases involves.
