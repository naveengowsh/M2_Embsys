# Block Diagram Components specifications:
The components provide a particular function or group of related functions.The ingredients
used in this project are Arduino UNO, LCD, MQ7, MQ135, DustSensor and DC fan. The 
specifications of parts are discussed.
# FEATURES OF BLOCK DIAGRAM COMPONENTS:
1] ARDUINO UNO:

Arduino Uno anmicrocontroller boarded sheet based on an 8-bit ATmega328P 
microcontroller. Additionally to the ATmega328P microcontroller, other components such 
as a crystal oscillator, serial communication, voltage regulator, etc. are included. The Arduino 
Uno has 14 digital I/O pins (out of which six are used for PWM outputs), and nine analog I/O 
pinssixanalogue input pins, a USB connection, A Power barrel jack, an ICSP header and a reset 
button.

2] LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY:

In an LCD television, the pixels are switched on or off electronically using liquid crystals
to rotate polarized light LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD
televisions, computer monitors ,instrument panels, aircraft cock pit displays, and indoor and 
outdoor signage .LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays) are used in embedded system applications to 
display various system parameters and statuses.LCD 16x2 is a 16-pin device of 2 rows that
can accommodate 16 characters each. LCD16x2 can be used in 4-bit modern 8-bitmode.It is
also possible tolerate custom characters. It has 8data lines and 3control lines that can be used
for control purposes.

3] TEMPERATURE SENSOR:

Maxim integrated's DS18B20 is a 1-wire programmable Temperature sensor. It is 
commonly used to detect temperature in difficult conditions such as chemical solutions, mines, 
and soil. The sensor's constriction is unequal, and it's also available with a waterproof option, 
making the growing process simple. It can measure a wide range of temperatures, from -55°C to 
+125°C, with a 5°C precision. Because each sensor has its own address and only uses one MCU 
pin to transport data, it's an excellent choice for measuring temperature at many locations without 
sacrificing too many of your microcontroller's digital pins.

4] DUST SENSORS:

Measurement of air quality is becoming more and more necessary in big cities due to air 
pollution and health problems it causes. There are many sensors on the 
market which can measure air quality, and recently, the very latest sensors get into the concern 
which have been developed.,GP2Y1010AU0F from Sharp is a small optical dust sensor that can 
detect dust and smoke particles. It consumes very little power while operating, which makes it 
ideal for an always-on monitoring system.

5] MQ-7 SENSOR:

* High sensitivity to carbon monoxide
* Stable and long life

6] MQ-135:

* Wide detecting scope
* Fast response and High sensitivity
* Stable and long life
* Operating Voltage is +5V
* Detect/Measure NH3, NOx, alcohol, Benzene, smoke, CO2, etc.
* *nalog output voltage: 0V to 5V
* Digital output voltage: 0V or 5V (TTL Logic)
* Preheat duration 20 seconds
* Can be used as a Digital or analog sensor
* The Sensitivity of Digital pin can be varied using the potentiometer

7] DC FAN:

This fan is used to suckout the harmful air.
